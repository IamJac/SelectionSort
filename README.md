SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM

PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT SELECTION SORT ALGORITHM

The program takes array inputs from a user,sorts the array then invokes the selection sort function.
How the algorithm works-The index of the current value of the outer loop is held to represent index of the minimum element.The value at that index is then compared with all the subsequent values in the array.This is done in order to obtain the index of the smallest element if you want to sort the array in ascending order.
After a new index for the minnimum value is obtained from the inner loop,the value held by the outer loop and the value in the minimum variable are swapped.The process is repeated until the array is sorted.This sorting takes place in polynomial time-O()n.
